Currently I am working on a case study for university. The expected result: an industrial web application created with Java EE.

We can choose from different tasks. I have decided to create an Application, that tracks Ghost nets in the ocean and allows users to interact with them in a certain way.

As soon as I am done with it I will post my findings here.
