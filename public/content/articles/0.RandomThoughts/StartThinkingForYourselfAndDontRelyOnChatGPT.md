So first things first. When I write an article. I am writing it myself. No editing with chat GPT but rather improving my own writing skills. 
I mean yes LLMs do a really good job but when you start noticing, that finding words on your own is difficult, you might have overdone it a little.
I am not saying you cant use it at all but use it conciously. Try thinking first even if it feels quicker with the help it often is not, because you start to accept half knowledge.
I noticed that asking for a detailed explaination, different approches and sources helps staying on top of the rabbits fur.

Always remember to ask about every little detail, so when you do something you actually understand why you are doing it.
